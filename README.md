# Petition
I signed a justice for Tamir Rice petition on change.org. Tamir was 12 years old playing in a park with a toy gun when he was shot 
killed by a police officer. The incident was captured on video. The police officer gave no warning. There was no time for Tamir
to react. It has been a year and the police officer involved has not been charged and the process for him to be charged has not
even started. This is yet another incident of police murder of a black body. Why is there no accountability? Why is there no justice?
This needs to end.
