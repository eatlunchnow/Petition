# Petition
I signed a petition for Tamir Rice on change.org. His family needs support to get a prosecutor appointed to his case.  Tamir was 12 years old playing in a park with a toy gun when he was shot and killed by a police officer. The incident was captured on video. The police officer gave no warning. There was no time for Tamir to react. It has been a year and the police officer involved has not been charged and the process for him to be charged has not even started. This is yet another incident of police murder of a black body. We need answers. We need justice.
