# Petition
I signed a justice for Tamir Rice petition on change.org. Tamir was 12 years old playing in a park with a toy gun when he was shot killed by a police officer. The incident was captured on video. The police officer gave no warning. There was no time for Tamirto react. It has been a year and the police officer involved has not been charged and the process for him to be charged has noteven started. Tamir's family would like support to appoint a prosecutor. This is yet another incident of police murder of a black body. We need answers. We need justice.
